               <h2>Cenotes</h2>
               <p>The cenotes are one of the most beautiful and interesting natural wonders of Mexico. They are water wells with a depth of 32 to 130&nbsp;ft that were created by the fall of the meteorite that killed the dinosaurs, which impacted the state of Yucatan. The impact created a ring of around 7,000 cenotes that crosses the state.</p>
               <p>For the Mayans, cenotes were considered entrances to the underworld and a point of contact with the god of rain, &quot;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaac" target="_blank">Chaac</a>&quot;, to whom they offered human and animal sacrifices, as well as relics and clothing.</p>
               <p>Many cenotes are open to the public and you are allowed to swim and dive in them, as well as take as many photos as you want. It is a unique experience that you do not want to miss.</p>
